# Ibis
This project was submitted to Creatica, where it won Best Artificial Intelligence Hack, and Ignition Hacks, where it won the First Place Division Delta Hack. It is meant
to increase engagment between students and teachers in the context of virtual learning. The first part of Ibis connects with assignment submission data, through
a platform like Gradescope, and assigns points to students based on their patterns of submitting early/on-time or late. Points can be used to earn students different 
prizes, which encourages completion of schoolwork. The second part of Ibis tracks students emotions using the deepface framework during Zoom lessons to provide insights to
teacher about which parts of the lesson students understood and didn't understand the most. This allows teachers to personalize their curriculum moving forward, while making
the most of the virtual format of their classes.
